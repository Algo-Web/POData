POData - OData for the Poor PHP Developer
============

POData (pronounced like the [sandwich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po'_boy)) a is an OData service framework for PHP Developers.  PHP Developers are dirt poor because they are not afforded a nice OData toolkit, but POData elimantes their poverty and brings the boutiful wealth of OData to the masses!.

POData vs odataphpprod
===================
POData started as a fork of [The OData Producer Library for PHP](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/odataphpprod).  Many thanks to that project for making this one possible.  The many goals of this fork are best tracked in the issues list but here are some highlights:

* OData v3 Compliant
* Full [BreezeJS](http://www.breezejs.com/) & [JayData](http://jaydata.org/) support (we love those libraries)
* Availability via Composer
* Simpler to plug in to common PHP frameworks (Zend, [Symphony](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2), [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel))
* Produce sample services that pass [OData Validation](http://services.odata.org/validation/)
* Offers your provider implementation more control on how to best execute the OData Query
* Optimized $expand support
* Support for an Annotation Based Provider Implementation

Long term goals include:

* OData v4 Support
* Create, Update, & Delete support
* Transaction support
* Port to Node
* Convince WordPress & MediaWiki to change their entire API to OData

    /**
     * This method is invoked by the data services framework to
     * retrieve the default stream associated
     * with the entity instance specified by the entity parameter.
     *
     * Notes to interface implementers:
     *  Concurrency check:
     *    An implementer of this method MUST perform concurrency checks
     *    as needed in their implementation of this method.
     *    If an If-Match or If-None-Match request header was
     *    included in the request, then the $etag parameter will be
     *    non null, which indicates this method MUST perform the
     *    appropriate concurrency check.  If the concurrency check
     *    passes, this method should return the requested stream.
     *    If the concurrency checks fails, the method should throw
     *    an ODataException with the appropriate HTTP response code
     *    as defined in HTTP RFC 2616 section 14.24 and section 14.26.
     *     a. If the etag was sent as the value of an If-Match request header,
     *     the value of the $checkETagForEquality header will be set to true.
     *     b. If the etag was sent as the value of an If-None-Match request header,
     *     the value of the $checkETagForEquality header will be set to false.
     * Using request headers in request:
     *   The $operationContext argument is passed as it is likely that
     *   an implementer of this interface method will need information
     *   from the HTTP request headers in order to construct
     *   a stream.  Likely header values required are:
     *    a. 'Accept'
     *    b. 'Accept-Charset'
     *    c. 'Accept-Encoding'
     * Setting response headers:
     *   An implementer of this method MUST NOT set the following
     *   HTTP response headers on the $operationContext parameter as
     *   they are set by the runtime:
     *    a. Content-Type
     *    b. ETag
     *  An implementer of this method may set HTTP response headers
     *  (other than those forbidden above)
     *  on the $operationContext parameter.
     *  An implementer of this method should only set the
     *  properties on the $operationContext parameter
     *  which it requires to be set for a successful response.
     *  Altering other properties on the
     *  $operationContext parameter may corrupt the response from the data service.
     *
     *  If an error occurs while reading the stream, then
     *  the data services framework will generate an
     * in-stream error which is sent back to the client.
     * See the error contract specification for a
     * description of the format of in-stream errors
     *
     *  If the stream returned from this method contains 0 byte,
     *  this method should set the response
     *  status code on the $operationContext.
     *
     * @param object            $entity               The stream returned should be

     * @param string            $eTag                 The etag value sent by the

     *                                                If[-None-]Match header)
